## Origin

This code is a fork of the [chess model](https://github.com/digital-asset/ex-models/tree/master/chess) developed by Bernhard Elsner and Georg Schneider, a lot of credit belongs to them. Whereas that code allowed arbitrary moves and evaluated their legality afterwards, we needed to generate legal moves in order to determine visibility. Consequently, the code was substantially reimplemented.
